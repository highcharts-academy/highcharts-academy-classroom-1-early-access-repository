# Welcome to the Highcharts Academy Repository

This repository is your gateway to learning and exploring the Highcharts library through practical exercises. GitHub Classroom will automatically grade the exercises, making your learning journey seamless.

Each exercise is self-contained, allowing you to learn at your own pace. Automated tests are provided for each exercise, which you can also run locally to verify your solutions.

Remember to carefully follow the guidelines in the `README.md` files for each task. 

**Good luck!** ðŸ˜Š

### Step 4: Running the Tests Locally

Each task comes with predefined Cypress tests to help you verify your solution. To run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test-all
```

If you want to test a specific exercise, use:

```bash
npm run test-{exercise-number}
```

For example, to test the first exercise:

```bash
npm run test-01
```

### Step 5: Submitting Your Solution

Once you have completed all tasks and ensured all tests pass:

1. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed assignment"
    ```

2. Push your changes to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

Replace `main` with your branch name if you're working on a different branch.
