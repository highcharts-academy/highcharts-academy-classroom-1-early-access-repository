## Exercise Overview

### Goal  
Learn to create a **column chart** and add an **annotation**.

---

## Instructions

### Objective 1: Create a Column Chart
1. **Create a simple column chart**:
   - Add a dataset with 5 random points (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 1.5, 0.4]`).
   - Documentation:  
     - [Column Chart Docs](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.type)  
     - [Column Chart Demo](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/column-basic)

2. **Solution**:  
   - Open the `main.js` file in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).  
   - Add the following code:  
     ```javascript
     Highcharts.chart('container', {
         chart: {
             type: 'column'
         },
         series: [{
             data: [1, 2, 3, 1.5, 0.4]
         }]
     });
     ```
   - Save your work.  
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the result.  
   - Run the command:  
     ```bash
     npm run test-00
     ```
   - If successful, you will see this output:  
    <img src="image/00-getting-started-image-1.png" alt="00-getting-started-image-1" width="70%">

### Objective 2: Add an Annotation
1. **Add an annotation module**:
   - Include the Highcharts Annotation module in your chart.  
   - Documentation:  
     - [Annotations Module](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/annotations)  
     - [Annotation Demo](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/annotations)

2. **Add an annotation to the third point**:
   - Example: Add a label above the third point with the text "Peak Value".  
   - Documentation:  
     - [Add Annotation to a Point](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/annotations.labelOptions)

3. **Solution**:  
   - Add the following annotation configuration to your chart:  
     ```javascript
     Highcharts.chart('container', {
         chart: {
             type: 'column'
         },
         series: [{
             data: [1, 2, 3, 1.5, 0.4]
         }],
         annotations: [{
             labels: [{
                 point: {
                     x: 2,
                     y: 3,
                     xAxis: 0,
                     yAxis: 0
                 },
                 text: 'Middle value'
             }]
         }]
     });
     ```
   - Save your work.
   - Go to `index.html`, and paste the annotation module
   ```html
   <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/annotations.js"></script>
   ```

   - Open `index.html` in your browser to see the annotation.
   - Run the command:  
     ```bash
     npm run test-00
     ```
   - If successful, you will see this output:
    <img src="image/00-getting-started-image-2.png" alt="00-getting-started-image-2" width="70%">
    
   - Go to the browser where you opened index.html, refresh the page, and you should see:

   <img src="image/00-getting-started-image-solution.png" alt="00-getting-started-image-solution" width="70%">
