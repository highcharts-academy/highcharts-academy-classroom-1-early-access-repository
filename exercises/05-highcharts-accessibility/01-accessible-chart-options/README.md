# Exercise 01 - Accessible chart options

Level: easy ‚≠ê

In this exercise, you will learn how to:

1. Include the accessibility module
2. Create a basic accessible chart by adding titles and labels to chart elements.
3. Adding names to series for better readability
4. Give suffix to a tooltip and make it sticky
5. Add a description to your chart.

In this task, you will create an interactive Highcharts chart with default values for the Accessibility module, which will make the chart more readable and easier to understand for sighted users and screen reader users. You will look at how a tooltip can easily be improved to provide readability and give the user an easier time exploring with it. You will also add a description to help your readers understand what the chart is about.
